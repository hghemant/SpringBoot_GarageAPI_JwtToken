## Development server

## Build

###### Phase 1:

Start by creating a page that will display all of the cars that Frank has across all of his warehouses. Please sort the list according to _date_added_ asc. Below you will find a section with some sample data that you can use as for you application.

First Screen : All cars all display with few details on screen.


 

###### Phase 2:

Now, allowing the user to click on any of the cars (that are licensed = true) would make it a lot nicer. Once the user clicked on a car, we then show more details such as, the warehouse where it is stored and its location perhaps? It is up to you how detailed you want to make it.

Second Screen : Choose any specific Car. All Details will display.

 
Add into Shopping cart and displaying the message as well. 

 

###### Phase 3:

Wow! Okay, we now have some good functionality! So lets take it one step further! Lets allow the user to add the car he is viewing to some sort of shopping cart so that he can easily checkout once he is done shopping. Oh, and perhaps we should show the user the total amount as well?

Last Screen : Display all the selected  cars after clicking on carts. Also Carts showing the quantity of selected cars.
